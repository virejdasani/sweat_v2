              Coursework Calendar is the (on-going) end-product of two Learning
              and Teaching Enhancement Project, funded by the Faculty of Science
              and Engineering at the University of Liverpool:

                In 2022-23: Project SWEAT: Student Workload Impact Evaluation
                Tool
              </li>
              <li>
                In 2023-24: Project ECHO: Effort and Coursework Handling Online
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The stated goal of this initiative was the development of an
              online portal, for students and staff, for the modelling and
              evaluation of student effort and workload across the academic
              year, developed and deployed in partnership with students, with
              the objective of reducing pain points and improving the student
              learning experience by spreading the effort as uniformly as
              possible throughout the academic year.
